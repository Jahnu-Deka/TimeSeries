Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA

This project focuses on time series analysis and forecasting using the ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) model. Time series data is a sequence of observations collected at regular intervals over time, and analyzing and forecasting this type of data is crucial in various domains, including finance, economics, and sales forecasting.

In this project, I explore the popular AirPassengers dataset, which records the number of airline passengers from 1949 to 1960. I leverage the power of the ARIMA model, a widely used approach for time series forecasting, to predict future passenger numbers based on historical patterns.

Key Steps:
1. Data Preprocessing: I preprocess the dataset, handle missing values, and ensure the data is in a suitable format for time series analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: I perform exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the underlying patterns, trends, and seasonality in the passenger data.
3. Time Series Decomposition: I use the ETS (Error, Trend, Seasonality) decomposition method to decompose the time series into its individual components.
4. Model Selection: I employ the auto_arima function to automatically select the optimal ARIMA model parameters based on the dataset.
5. Model Training and Evaluation: I train the ARIMA model on a subset of the data, evaluate its performance using metrics like RMSE, and visualize the predicted values against the actual values.
6. Forecasting: Finally, I train the ARIMA model on the entire dataset and generate future forecasts to predict passenger numbers for the next few years.

By sharing this project on GitHub, I aim to showcase my expertise in time series analysis, data preprocessing, and model building. Feel free to explore the code, replicate the analysis, and provide feedback or suggestions for improvement.

Technologies Used: Python, pandas, matplotlib, pmdarima, statsmodels..
